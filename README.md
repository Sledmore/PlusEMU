# PlusEMU
Continuing to work on Plus Emulator, on and off.

This is technically revision 3, I am working from Revision #2. SQLs etc, should all be uptodate. The goals of this project are as follows:

* Basic refactor (correcting naming conventions).
* Improve the complexity in methods.
* Improve emulator code.
* Keep the emulator up to date.
* Finish missing features.

Lots of work to be done, mostly will be refactoring for a while.
